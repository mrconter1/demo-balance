# Demo Quality Balance

An interactive visualization tool that illustrates the inherent trade-offs between three competing aspects of demo development:

- **Demo's Impression Level**: How impressive the demo appears to customers
- **Demo Completion Speed**: How quickly the demo can be executed
- **Process Teaching Quality**: How effectively the process is explained to beginners

## Purpose

In demo development, we often face a three-way tension:
- Making something impressive
- Doing it quickly
- Teaching others meaningfully along the way

This tool helps visualize how these aspects compete for resources. With a fixed total of 200 points, increasing one aspect necessarily requires decreasing others, reflecting real-world trade-offs in demo development and teaching scenarios.

Built with Next.js, TypeScript, and Framer Motion.
